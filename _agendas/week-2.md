### Homework
- Review your interview pairing. Decide on a time to conduct the interview and agree on desired format (Zoom, text message, email, etc.)
- Think of a topic you’d like to interview your partner about. It could be about their origin, their interest in snails, their goals for the class etc. but you should be able to explain what you’re interested in. It might be helpful to chat with your partner before you officially interview them.
- Write 10 questions to ask your partner in advance. Then, conduct the interview.
Complete the interview and come to class with the documentation (transcript, process, any images). You must have a written component.
- Once you&rsquo;ve done the interview, select one of your question and answer pairs and sketch it out in 10 different ways in Figma. Design at 100% and make sure you have reasons for your design decisions. All ten versions should use distinct typefaces but all be appropriate choices for your final draft.
- Contribute one entry to your design journal
- Read [The Crystal Goblet – Beatrice Warde](http://ci17.nikasimovich.com/assets/readings/warde-beatrice_the-crystal-goblet.pdf), [Drowning the Crystal Goblet – Matthew Butterick](https://practicaltypography.com/drowning-the-crystal-goblet.html), and [What&rsquo;s Crystal Goblet in Korean – Jiwon Lee](https://designobserver.com/article.php?id=29138) and [write a response](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/F21-Core-Interaction-Reading-Responses--BR7i0GnqYkeCVZ~UdNT4ezo1AQ-011CWC5qJgFfgpIVOrIYA) that compares all three readings with a focus on what the crystal goblet is.
