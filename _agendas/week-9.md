- Small groups: Rock Garden check in


### Homework

- Based on today&rsquo;s feedback, select your idea for the Rock Garden. Collect the assets you'll need to use on the website, and create a lo-fidelity sitemap or wireframe of your project. Next, develop two different visual directions for your project â€“ please include a title and description, a visual research/a moodboard, and a homepage sketch for both versions. Both should be appropriate to your content but visually distinct, similar to the examples I shared in class.
- Complete the CSS animation activity and submit it on Canvas
