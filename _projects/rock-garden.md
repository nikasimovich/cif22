### Overview
A rock garden is a controlled plot of ground that highlights a curated assortment of rocks, stones, and boulders. Most rock gardens are carefully landscaped and any additional shrubs, trees, and agriculture is carefully groomed and selected. When a specific type of rock is collected, it becomes a typology – a classification according to general type.

For this project, you’ll create your own “rock garden” in the browser. You should move away from the “rock” metaphor, and develop a typology of your own (for example: Google Street View screenshots of beaches; People with pink hair on the street). Your typology can be demonstrated with any media – photo, graphic, writing, videos, or a mix of different types. In addition to a conceptual theme, consider how to visually unify the items in your garden.

Your Rock Garden should have 20 “rocks”  in it and can be housed on a single page or multi-page website. When viewing the garden, a narrative should emerge about your typology and draw the user in to what you found interesting about it.
