### Overview
Throughout the semester, you should be keeping an ongoing design journal. The design journal can be either on DropBox Paper or Google Doc. Each week you’ll contribute an example of something you’re looking at and are inspired by. Contribute a photo or video of the item and then respond to the following
questions:

1. What is the piece of inspiration you’re documenting?
2. Where did you encounter it? What was the setting like?
3. Describe the functionality of the object. Who was it designed for? Why was it designed? How
does the design compliment its purpose?
4. What do you like about this piece of inspiration? What attracted you to it initially?
5. Does this piece connect to other other topics in art design in this or any of your other classes?


### Due Dates
Design journals should be worked on each week. They will be submitted for review twice: once at midterms and once at the end of the semester.
